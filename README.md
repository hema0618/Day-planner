# Day-planner
A place to store the daily tasks a user may encounter during a typical workday. This day planner allows the user to enter and save a task in each hour block. The blocks are color-coded to let the user know which events have passed, are happening, and are coming up. The user's inputs are saved to the page using local storage.
